This is the talk materials repository of the "[Use Case Seminars 2](https://courses.ceu.edu/courses/2018-2019/use-case-seminars-2)" course in the 2019/2020 Winter term, part of the [MSc in Business Analytics](https://courses.ceu.edu/programs/ms/master-science-business-analytics) at CEU. For the previous edition, see [2018/2019 Spring](https://github.com/daroczig/CEU-use-case-seminars/tree/2019-spring).

## Course Description

This class is a series of guest talks from industry experts followed by Q&A sessions, where you can learn about real-world data-science questions and problems, then the related solutions, products and teams -- right from the trenches, featuring senior data scientists, data engineers and data team leads from startups and enterprises as well. The examples demonstrated and discussed in these sessions will not only help you with ideas for the cap/final project, but will also show you the different aspects of real-world data science and give you some ideas on what to expect at your future job.

We invite 1-2 experts each week to deliver a case study of a real data science problem and solution, followed up by Q&A and then R exercises related to the discussed case studies.

This is a Pass / Fail class. Students are required to attend all 3 weeks and actively participate in the Q&A and R exercises sessions.
